# Work Experience

## Santander – 2018
Worked at Santander for 1 week for work experience during secondary school. During this week I observed how the employees would greet and talk to the customers to make them feel welcome.

## Dreamland – Apr 2019 till Nov 2019
I operated different rides, checked the health safety of the ride, and completed necessary paperwork. Customer service was a big part of this position.
